# AI Project

## Overview
This project is designed to develop and train an AI model using various datasets. The project structure is organized to facilitate data management, model training, and experimentation.

## Project Structure
- **data/raw**: Contains raw data files for training the AI model.
- **data/processed**: Stores processed data files that have been cleaned and transformed for model training.
- **models**: Directory for saving the trained AI models.
- **notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for experiments, visualizations, and analyses.
- **src**: Source code for the project.
  - **__init__.py**: Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - **train.py**: Logic for training the AI model.
  - **predict.py**: Logic for making predictions using the trained AI model.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Examples
- To train the model, run:
  ```
  python src/train.py
  ```
- To make predictions, use:
  ```
  python src/predict.py
  ```
